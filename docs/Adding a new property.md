In here I will document the steps necessary to add  a new field to the database.

As a rule, it is simpler to just start from one end and go through all steps.

### Domain Layer

We start from the Entity itself, the one that is used to store in the database and then we should modify all related DTOs.







### Presentation Layer
Unless this proves to be a major change, such as was the approved state, no modifications are required at this level.
